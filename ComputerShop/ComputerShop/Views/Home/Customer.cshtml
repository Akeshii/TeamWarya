        <h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
        <h4>Has my order been sent?</h4>
        <span>
            We have had the full pressure during Black Friday and we work with maximum speed to send your order as soon as possible. It may take a few extra days before your order is sent and we hope for your understanding. As soon as your order is sent, you will receive a shipping confirmation e-mail.
        </span>
        <hr />
        <h4>Can I get my parcel?</h4>
        <span>
            Parcel number for your shipment is sent to you via email when your order has left our warehouse. Remember that it can take up to 24 hours before delivery can be traced (the order is sent, but is only detectable when the package reaches a Swedish postal terminal.
            We ship our products from our central warehouse in Norway. Normal delivery time is about 1-3 days.
        </span>
        <hr />
        <h4>My order has the status sent, but it is at PostNord page that you have not sent the order, terms?</h4>
        <span>
            We ship our products from our central warehouse in Norway and therefore it can sometimes happen that deliveries are not traceable the first 24 hours. You can track your delivery as soon as the package arrived at a mail terminal in Sweden.
